A simple JavaScript app which helps you track your workouts.

Users can add running and cycling workouts (locations, duration, distance, cadence/elevation gain) which are interactively shown on a Leaflet map. 


This app is the result of the "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!
" bootcamp on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann. I added a few improvements to the app (delete all workouts, show all workout markers, rebuilding Cycling/Running objects after loading from internal storage, delete single workout)
